Update branch.
Moved to Jack's server.
Is it working?

To use webpack ensure that npm is installed. Run npm install in the root of the directory. Run 'npm run build'. Webpack will pack any js referenced in src/index.js and place it in assets/js/bundle.js. Webpack will then watch for any changes and repack each time a change is detected.
